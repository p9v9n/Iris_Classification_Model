# Iris_Classification_Model
The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning, and it's often used for practicing classification algorithms. The dataset contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for three species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).
